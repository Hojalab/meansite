  <h2>Packages Overview</h2>

  <p>The mean.io package system is a system allowing developers to create modular code that provides useful tools that other mean projects could use. The packages are plug and play and are used in a very similar way to traditional npm packages.</p>

	<p>The meanio npm package integrates all the packages into the mean project as if the code was part of mean itself and provides the developers with all the necceesary tools required to integrate their package into the host project.</p>

	<p>Packages are mini mean projects and follow similar desgign principles of a traditional mean app, without the overhead.</p>

  <h2>Your First Package</h2>

	Mean.io comes with its own command line interface (CLI). The CLI provides a scaffolding function to create a default Package. 

	From the root of your mean project issue the following command

	<style>.ace_editor { height: 55px;font-size:16px;}</style>
	<div ui-ace="{ mode:'BatchFile', theme:'monokai', FontSize:'18px'}" readonly="true">
		mean package myPackage;
	</div>
		
	<p>Restart your app and login. You will notice a link in the main menu to an example page</p>

	<p class="alert alert-success">Congratulations you are now the official creator of a mean package!</p>
