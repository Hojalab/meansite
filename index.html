          <p>Segment 1: Web Design Trends You Need to Watch Out For (2:56)</p>

<p>Several years ago when the “Web 2.0″ movement hit, I lost my entire freelance business because I didn’t actually know how to code. I had been using MS FrontPage to build static HTML web sites for clients.</p>

<p>And the move to dynamic database-driven web sites killed me.</p>

<p>That taught me to pay close attention to web trends and to break them down to understand the larger motivations at work. So, I could begin to predict trends and stay ahead of the curve.</p>

<p>In this segment, I break down 8 of the hottest web design trends in 2014 and show you the larger forces at work… so you can begin to predict what’s going to happen and adapt your business accordingly so you don’t get destroyed like I did.
